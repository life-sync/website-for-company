Create a website for a company called Sync-X. The task is:
You're a member of sync-x, a crowdsourced initiative, working to improve the status of online education in remote towns/villages in this unprecedented time. Owing to the challenges faced by schools/colleges, your team has come up with a software which uses very low bandwidth to stream online content, making it ideal for places with connectivity issues. In order to get your product to the market, create a branding website for the solution you've come up with.

The website should ideally contain 4-5 pages/sections essentially describing the solution and the company. Although not mandatory, you're free to extend backend functionality to your website.
